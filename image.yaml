    - name: JAVA_MAX_MEM_RATIO
      description: Is used when no `-Xmx` option is given in **JAVA_OPTIONS**. This is used to calculate a default maximal heap memory based on a containers restriction. If used in a Docker container without any memory constraints for the container then this option has no effect. If there is a memory constraint then `-Xmx` is set to a ratio of the container available memory as set here. The default is `50` which means 50% of the available memory is used as an upper boundary. You can skip this mechanism
            by setting this value to `0` in which case no `-Xmx` option is added.

      description: The classpath to use. If not given, the startup script checks for a file `**JAVA_APP_DIR/classpath**` and use its content literally as classpath. If this file doesn't exists all jars in the app dir are added (`classes:**JAVA_APP_DIR/***`).
